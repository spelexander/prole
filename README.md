Prole is a Chrome browser extension that checks for political endorsements 🇦🇺

Prole will tell you whether a news website has endorsed a political party during a recent Australian election.


## Motivation
Prole seeks to help readers understand unseen political bias in their
content by displaying publicly available information about the authoring
entity.
